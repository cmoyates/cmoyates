## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cris, and I'm a fullstack developer! I have experience with the React/Typescript/AWS stack on a professional level, and have worked on some personal projects with the likes of Python, Flutter, and Unity. I am currently seeking full-time employment.

### What I'm currently working on 

Currently I'm trying to teach myself Flutter and Android app development by working on my "Recommended" app (name is still a work in progress).

I'm also looking to redesign my personal portfolio soon, but I haven't gotten started on that quite yet.
