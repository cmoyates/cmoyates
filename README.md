## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cris, and I'm a fullstack developer! I have experience with the React/Typescript/AWS stack on a professional level, and have worked on some personal projects with the likes of Python, Flutter, and Unity. I am currently seeking full-time employment.

### What I'm currently working on 

Currently I'm trying to figure out the logistics of creating a 2D roguelike game in Unity! I'm trying to make sure I have stuff planned out ahead of time to avoid headaches down the road.

I'm also looking to redesign my personal portfolio soon, but I haven't gotten started on that quite yet.
